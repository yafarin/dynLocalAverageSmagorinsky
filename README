Implementation of the dynamic Smagorinsky model with coefficients cD and
cI computed as local average of their face values to avoid numerical 
instabilities. 
    
Negative values of the effective viscosity are removed by clipping it to
zero (nuSgs is clipped to -nu)

The code is known to work with OpenFOAM 1.7.x
